Wiggelen is a light-weigh library. It is tried not to over-engineer by using
builtin datatypes such as tuples instead of custom objects. Sane defaults are
used throughout and things like indices are handled in the background
transparently.

The central operation in Wiggelen is walking a track. Be it in ``fixedSteps``
or ``variableSteps`` format, using any window size and step interval, walking
a track yields values one position at a time. Many operations accept walkers
as input and/or return walkers as output.
